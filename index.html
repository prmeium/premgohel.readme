                i like building things that feel alive.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                content that makes you stop scrolling.<br>
                communities that don't feel transactional.<br>
                ideas that start messy, get shaped in public, and slowly turn into something real.

                i've never been great at doing things "the normal way."<br>
                i've always been more interested in why something works than how it's supposed to look on paper.

                for the last few years, i've been deep in the middle of building.
            </p>
            <p>
                working with builders, startups, brands, and local businesses — helping them figure out their voice, their story, and how to show up online without sounding like everyone else.
            </p>
            <p>
                i've shot content for cars, cafes, concerts, and companies.<br>
                worked behind cameras and behind the scenes.<br>
                helped founders translate their ideas into something people actually engage with.
            </p>
            <p>
                but the most important thing i've built is baithak.

                    <h3>baithak</h3>
                    <span class="project-year">ongoing</span>
                </div>
                <p>
                    baithak started as a simple idea:
                </p>
                <p>
                    what if we built a space where builders, creators, and operators actually showed up — not to flex, but to build?
                </p>
                <p>
                    no panels for the sake of panels.<br>
                    no networking that feels forced.<br>
                    just rooms with people who care about shipping things.
                </p>
                <p>
                    it turned into meetups, workshops, cohorts, side projects, and long conversations that didn't end when the event did.
                </p>
                <p class="insight">
                    building baithak taught me something important:<br>
                    community isn't about scale first — it's about signal.
                </p>
                <p>
                    get the room right, and everything compounds.
                </p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="project-item">
                <h3>content & community</h3>
                <p>
                    i don't separate content and community.<br>
                    they're the same thing to me.
                </p>
                <p>
                    good content attracts the right people.<br>
                    good people create better content.<br>
                    repeat.
                </p>
                <p>
                    that loop is what i'm obsessed with.
                </p>
                <p>
                    whether it's a reel, a website, an event, or a cohort — i think in terms of:
                </p>
                <p>
                    does this feel honest?<br>
                    does this feel intentional?<br>
                    would i show up to this if my name wasn't on it?
                </p>
                <p>
                    if the answer is no, we rework it.

            <p>right now, i'm thinking a lot about:</p>
            
            <p>
                building small, high-signal communities<br>
                content that feels human again<br>
                internet-first brands with taste<br>

            <p>
                i like ideas that can be tested quickly, improved publicly, and iterated without ego.

                care about craft<br>
                have opinions<br>
                aren't afraid to try things that might not work
            </p>
            
            <p>
                the goal isn't perfection.<br>
                the goal is momentum.
